# VRPTW
## A Vehicle routing problem with Time window(VRPTW) solution

Solution build with Python and Deap
This solution is a modification from the py-ga-VRPTW repository(https://github.com/iRB-Lab/py-ga-VRPTW)
Changes made:
	-It's a multi Objective solution
	-Best Cost Route Crossover as a crossover
	-Evaluating 2 objectives
	-Mutatition
